Basic nixos configuration and dotfiles for my personal desktop/wm setup.

As time goes on I expect the nix configuration here will become more complex and better, however I don't aim for this to be perfectly reproducible as it's for my own, casual, use.

This Sway, Waybar, and Mako config here is effectively a tweaked version of https://github.com/arkboix/sway and was based on the dotfiles there.

I didn't intend for others to install this or use this as a base, but feel free to do so, and you can look in my configuration.nix to see what packages are pulled in by sway to see what packages I have used for the wm setup.
